/**
 * Listener for metrics events. Extend this class to monitor the quantity, size, and duration of
 * your application's HTTP calls.
 *
 * All start/connect/acquire events will eventually receive a matching end/release event, either
 * successful (non-null parameters), or failed (non-null throwable). The first common parameters of
 * each event pair are used to link the event in case of concurrent or repeated events e.g.
 * `dnsStart(call, domainName)` â†’ `dnsEnd(call, domainName, inetAddressList)`.
 *
 * Events are typically nested with this structure:
 *
 *  * call ([callStart], [callEnd], [callFailed])
 *    * proxy selection ([proxySelectStart], [proxySelectEnd])
 *    * dns ([dnsStart], [dnsEnd])
 *    * connect ([connectStart], [connectEnd], [connectFailed])
 *      * secure connect ([secureConnectStart], [secureConnectEnd])
 *    * connection held ([connectionAcquired], [connectionReleased])
 *      * request ([requestFailed])
 *        * headers ([requestHeadersStart], [requestHeadersEnd])
 *        * body ([requestBodyStart], [requestBodyEnd])
 *      * response ([responseFailed])
 *        * headers ([responseHeadersStart], [responseHeadersEnd])
 *        * body ([responseBodyStart], [responseBodyEnd])
 *
 * This nesting is typical but not strict. For example, when calls use "Expect: continue" the
 * request body start and end events occur within the response header events. Similarly,
 * [duplex calls][RequestBody.isDuplex] interleave the request and response bodies.
 *
 * Since connections may be reused, the proxy selection, DNS, and connect events may not be present
 * for a call. In future releases of OkHttp these events may also occur concurrently to permit
 * multiple routes to be attempted simultaneously.
 *
 * Events and sequences of events may be repeated for retries and follow-ups.
 *
 * All event methods must execute fast, without external locking, cannot throw exceptions, attempt
 * to mutate the event parameters, or be re-entrant back into the client. Any IO - writing to files
 * or network should be done asynchronously.
